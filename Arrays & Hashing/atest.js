Example--
s = abccde
Break  into two parts: 'abc' and 'cde'. 
Note that all letters have been used, the substrings are contiguous and their lengths are equal. 
Now you can change 'a' and 'b' in the first substring to 'd' and 'e' to have 'dec' and 'cde' which are anagrams. 
Two changes were necessary.
